# Java-Arithmatic-Operation

This is a simple GUI calculator app that will perform basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction only. The project is an application of what I learned in Java, showing step-by-step addition and subtraction and tracing parts of a byte.

# Java-Arithmatic-Operation

<h5>This is a simple calculator based on a graphical user interface, where many modes can be added and control the size and design of the buttons, it came as a practical application of what I learned in Java and object-oriented programming concepts where the swing library was used and some Layuot UI Manger was used.

Where you can learn step-by-step addition and subtraction, how numbers are processed, and how to delete them.</h5>
